# Arma 2: OA Autosplitter
Autosplitter for Arma 2: OA

Starts upon player getting control.
Ends upon the mission complete menu appearing.

Probably not functional yet due to pointer fraudery

# NOTES

Currently, going back to the mission select screen will trigger a split

There is no reset condition implemented yet, so make sure to reset manually and/or have the timer on 0.00 before attempting

This autosplitter is still experimental, don't use it unless you're willing to take a chance of runs not being recorded correctly

# To do:

- Detect level

- Settings

- Subsplits

- Reset conditions

- Find consistent pointers after PC restart (and possibly for other PCs)

# Installation:

- Go into Livesplit
- Edit Layout
- Add "Scriptable Auto Splitter"
- Select the file you downloaded from here
- Should be good to go!
